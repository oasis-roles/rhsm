RHSM
=====

This role will register or unregister a system using `subscription-manager`, and can also enable or disable
repositories available via subscription.

Requirements
------------

Ansible 2.8 or higher

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or equivalent

Valid Red Hat Subscriptions

Role Variables
--------------

Currently the following variables are supported:

### Subscription Management

Vars in this section directly correspond to the args available to the
[redhat_subscription module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/redhat_subscription_module.html).

* `rhsm_username` - access.redhat.com or Satellite (RHSM Provider) username
* `rhsm_password` - access.redhat.com or Satellite (RHSM Provider) password
* `rhsm_org_id` - RHSM Provider organization ID
* `rhsm_activationkey` - RHSM Provider activation key
* `rhsm_server_hostname` - hostname for alternate RHSM provider
* `rhsm_server_insecure` - disable certificate verification when connecting to RHSM Provider (bool, default false)
* `rhsm_baseurl` - Alternate base URL of package repositories if not using Red Hat CDN
* `rhsm_server_proxy_hostname` - HTTP proxy hostname
* `rhsm_server_proxy_port` - HTTP proxy port
* `rhsm_server_proxy_user` - HTTP proxy username
* `rhsm_server_proxy_password` - HTTP proxy password
* `rhsm_auto_attach` - automatically consume from available subscriptions if registration succeeds (bool, default false, requires ansible >= 2.5)
* `rhsm_environment` - Register with a specific environment in the destination org. (Used with Red Hat Satellite 6 or Katello)
* `rhsm_pool` - Specific pool name to consume (regex can be used as input). Use `rhsm_pool_ids` when possible as it is much faster. Mutually exclusive with `rhsm_pool_ids`
* `rhsm_pool_ids` - List of pool IDs to consume, or a list of dicts with pool IDs as keys and quantity of entitlements to consume as values. Mutually exclusive with `rhsm_pool`
* `rhsm_consumer_type` - The type of unit to register (defaults to "system")
* `rhsm_consumer_name` - Name of the system to register (defaults to system hostname)
* `rhsm_consumer_id` - Existing consumer ID to resume a previous registration
* `rhsm_force_register` - Register the system even if it is already registered (bool, default false)
* `rhsm_syspurpose` - Dictionary of attributes for populating `syspurpose.json` file on RHEL 8 systems (*Requires ansible>=2.9*)
* `rhsm_unregister` - Unregister a system if true. The system will be unregistered. **System registration will not be attempted if this is true**.
  (bool, default false)

### Repository Management

Note:
> Using variables related to repository management may result in the role reporting a failure if the system is not registered.
> Subscription tasks are run before repository management tasks to ensure the correct registration state before processing these variables.

* `rhsm_release` - Set which operating system release version to use. Remember to quote this for release versions that look like
  floats to the YAML parser, e.g.  set the value to something like `"7.4"`, not `7.4`. Values like `6Server` and `7Server` do not
  need to be quoted.
* `rhsm_release_unset` - Unset which operating system release version to use (bool, default false)
* `rhsm_repositories` - Specifies which repositories to enable/disable, details below

If both `rhsm_release` and `rhsm_release_unset` are set, `rhsm_release_unset` will happen before the `rhsm_release` is set,
and this role will no longer operate idempotently when setting the release.

To enable/disable specific repositories:

```yaml
rhsm_repositories:
  enabled:
    - enabled-repository
  disabled:
    - disabled-repository
```

The list of repositories in `disabled` is processed before `enabled`.

To idempotently enable only specific repositories and disable all others,
setting `disabled` to `'*'` is supported:

```yaml
rhsm_repositories:
  disabled:
    - '*'
  enabled:
    - enabled-repository-1
    - enabled-repository-2
```

Note that globbing in repository names is supported, e.g.:

```yaml
rhsm_repositories:
  disabled:
    - '*'
  enabled:
    - 'enabled-repository*'
```

To set a specific minor version of RHEL repositories to use:

```yaml
rhsm_release: "7.1"
```

To default to the latest available minor version of repositories:

```yaml
rhsm_release_unset: true
```

Dependencies
------------

Requires a system that supports the installation and usage of `subscription-manager`, e.g.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Privilege escalation (sudo) is required for this role to function.

Example Playbooks
-----------------

This example registers a system with a username and password, auto-attaches,
enables three RHEL 7 repositories, and explictly sets the repository release
version of enabled repositories to "7Server".

```yaml
- hosts: rhsm-servers
  roles:
    - role: rhsm
  vars:
    rhsm_username: your_username
    rhsm_password: your_password
    rhsm_auto_attach: true
    rhsm_repositories:
      only:
        - rhel-7-server-rpms
        - rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
        - rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
    rhsm_release: 7Server
```

---

This example registers a system to Red Hat Satellite 6 using an organization ID and activation key,
and attaches to a specific pool by ID.

```yaml
- hosts: rhsm-servers
  roles:
    - role: rhsm
  vars:
    rhsm_org_id: your_organization_id
    rhsm_activationkey: activation_key
    rhsm_pool_ids:
      - poolid
    rhsm_server_hostname: your.satellite6.hostname
```

CA Certificates for Satellite 6 or Katello host should be installed first for HTTPS to work
when being used as the RHSM Provider.

Changes
-------

### `rhsm_repositories.only` deprecated

Prior to the introduction of the `purge` parameter to the `rhsm_repository` module in Ansible
2.8, in order to allow for idempotent operation when enabling certain repositories and
disabling all others, the following syntax was supported by this role, but is now
deprecated:

```yaml
rhsm_repositories:
  only:
    - enabled-repository-1
    - enabled-repository-2
```

Support for the more idiomatic usage of subscription-manager has since been
added to the role, so this operation is now idempotent:

```yaml
rhsm_repositories:
  disabled:
    - '*'
  enabled:
    - enabled-repository-1
    - enabled-repository-2
```

As a result, an in order for there to be "one -- and preferably only one -- obvious
way to do it," the `only` key in the `rhsm_repositories` dictionary is deprecated, and
support for it may be removed in a future release of this role. It is currently
maintained in this role for backward compatibility.

Note that the use of `only` is still mutually exclusive with the use of
`enabled` or `disabled` in the `rhsm_repositories` dictionary.

### Requires Ansible >= 2.8

New features in the `rhsm_repository` Ansible module are being used by this role.
If using an older version of Ansible, version 2.0.0 of this role can be used.

```yaml
# example requirements.yaml to install version 2.0.0
- name: oasis_roles.rhsm
  version: 2.0.0
```
